Hi! This is a small project that I made, it's a Rent a car app that provides delivering of a car to address of choice.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions in which way I can improve it feel free to message me.

Firebase is used for database and user auth, there aren't any e-mail validators so you can sign up with made up credentials.

There is stripe API included for making payments, though it is disabled because of security reasons, you can just click on Pay button and order will be placed.
Every order is logged to firebase.

You can start a local server with npm start.

Thanks and I hope you like it.
